# burger

## Overview 
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## App Setup
npm init, npm install express, express-handlebars, install mysql

## DB Setup
schema.sql and seeds.sql
